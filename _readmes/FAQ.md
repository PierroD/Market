### 🤦 Can you add another Call of Duty Game ?

I can between Call of Duty 4 and Black Ops 2 inlcuded, but above the game is a 64bit based game and I don't know how to create those, sorry 🥲

### 🆓 Why does it take you so long to release an update ? 

I'm doing it on my free time, beside job, friends, family, etc...

I prefer not to at the moment, but who knows 😏
